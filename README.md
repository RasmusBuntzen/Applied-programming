# Applied-programming
This repository is for the course Applied programming I took in block 4 2023. It is an introduction to programming in C++.

## Compile and Run
To use the programs for each week please compile the main.cpp file.
Use wsl command in windows terminal to simulate a linux machine. If clang++ is installed compiling can be done like this:   clang++ main.cpp -o main

The compiled code can then be run by:   ./main
